## Overview

This tutorial covers the endpoints provided by Hugging Face. There are two types of endpoints available: Serverless and Dedicated. It is a basic tutorial that begins with obtaining a Hugging Face token in order to use these endpoints.

You can learn the following topics:
- How to obtain a Hugging Face token
- How to use Serverless Endpoints
- How to use Dedicated Endpoints

## About Huggingface Endpoints

**What is Hugging Face Hub?**

It is a platform that hosts over 120,000 models, more than 20,000 datasets, and 50,000 demo apps (Spaces).
All resources are open-source and publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view and collaborate.


**What are Endpoints?**

Endpoints act like doors that let your application easily connect to models.
They help you add various machine learning features to your app effortlessly.

**Text Generation Inference**

It uses a special server built specifically for fast text generation.
This server is built using Rust, Python, and gRPC, offering excellent performance.

## Obtaining a Huggingface Token

After signing up on Hugging Face, you can obtain a token from the following [URL](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens).

## Reference Model List

Below is a link to the Hugging Face LLM leaderboard, Model List, LogicKor. For more information, you can check the link.

- [Huggingface LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)  
- [Model list](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&sort=downloads)  
- [LogicKor Leaderboard](https://lk.instruct.kr/)  
  LogicKor Leaderboard's link is for the leaderboard of Korean models. As the model performance increased, it has been archived due to meaningless scores as of October 17, 2024. However, you can find the best-performing Korean models.

## Using Hugging Face Endpoints
To use Hugging Face Endpoints, install the ```huggingface_hub``` package in Python.  
We previously installed ```huggingface_hub``` through ```langchain-opentutorial```. However, if you need to install it separately, you can do so by running the ```pip install huggingface_hub``` command.

To use the Hugging Face endpoint, you need an API token key. If you don't have a huggingface token follwing this [here](#Obtaining-a-Huggingface-Token).

If you have already set the token in ```HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN```, the API token is automatically recognized.

**OR**

You can use ```from huggingface_hub import login```.

```python
import os
from huggingface_hub import login

if not os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN']:
    login()
else:
    print("You have a HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN")
```

<pre class="custom">You have a HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN
</pre>

## Serverless Endpoints

The Inference API is free to use but comes with usage limitations. For production-level inference solutions, consider using the [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index) service.

Inference Endpoints enable you to deploy any machine learning model seamlessly on dedicated, fully managed infrastructure. You can tailor the deployment to align with your model, latency, throughput, and compliance requirements by selecting the cloud provider, region, compute instance, auto-scaling range, and security level.

Below is an example of how to access the Inference API.

- [Serverless Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index)
- [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index)

First of all, create a simple prompt using ```PromptTemplate```

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = """<|system|>
You are a helpful assistant.<|end|>
<|user|>
{question}<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
```

**[Note]** 
- In this example, the model used is ```microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct```  
- If you want change aother model, assign the HuggingFace model's repository ID to the variable ```repo_id```.  
- link : https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpoint

# Set the repository ID of the model to be used.
repo_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"

llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(
    repo_id=repo_id,  # Specify the model repository ID.
    max_new_tokens=256,  # Set the maximum token length for generation.
    temperature=0.1,
)

# Initialize the LLMChain and pass the prompt and language model.
chain = prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()
# Execute the LLMChain by providing a question and print the result.
response = chain.invoke({"question": "what is the capital of South Korea?"})
```

The response is below :

```python
print(response)
```

<pre class="custom">The capital of South Korea is Seoul. Seoul is not only the capital but also the largest metropolis in South Korea. It is a bustling city known for its modern skyscrapers, high-tech subways, and pop culture, as well as its historical sites such as palaces, temples, and traditional markets.
</pre>

## Dedicated Endpoints 
Using free serverless APIs allows you to quickly implement and iterate your solutions. However, because the load is shared with other requests, there can be rate limits for high-volume use cases.

For enterprise workloads, it is recommended to use [Inference Endpoints - Dedicated](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/dedicated). This gives you access to a fully managed infrastructure that offers greater flexibility and speed.

These resources also include ongoing support, guaranteed uptime, and options like AutoScaling.

- Set the Inference Endpoint URL to the ```hf_endpoint_url``` variable.

**[Note]**
- This [address](https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview) is not a Dedicated Endpoint but rather a public endpoint provided by Hugging Face. Because Dedicated Endpoints are a paid service, a public endpoint was used for this example.
- For more details, please refer to [this link](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints).

![06-huggingface-endpoints-dedicated-endpoints-03](./img/06-huggingface-endpoints-dedicated-endpoints-03.png)

```python
hf_endpoint_url = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview"
```

```python
llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(
    endpoint_url=hf_endpoint_url, # Set endpoint
    max_new_tokens=512,
    temperature=0.01,
)

# Run the language model for the given prompt.
llm.invoke(input="What is the capital of South Korea?")
```




<pre class="custom">' The capital of South Korea is Seoul.'</pre>



The following example shows the code implemented using a chain.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. "
            "The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.",
        ),
        ("user", "Human: {question}\nAssistant: "),
    ]
)

chain = prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()
```

```python
chain.invoke({"question": "what is the capital of South Korea?"})
```




<pre class="custom">" Seoul is the capital of South Korea. It's a vibrant city known for its rich history, modern architecture, and bustling markets.
