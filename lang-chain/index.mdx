The LangChain community in Seoul is excited to announce the LangChain OpenTutorial, a brand-new resource designed for everyone. This tutorial builds upon the foundation of the existing tutorial available here: [link](https://github.com/teddylee777/langchain-kr) written in Korean.

Within this new repository, we offer the following enhancements to benefit users of all skill levels:

- **Addressing global use cases** for international users,
- **Diving deep into cutting-edge features** including the recent updates available at the latest version of LangChain and LangGraph release, and
- **Demonstrating additional goodies** that showcase real-world uses and further applications.

At this base repository, it serves as a home for both beginners and seasoned LangChain users. The tutorial whould provide a roadmap for learning LangChain, while also offering a valuable refresher for those already familiar with its functionalities.
