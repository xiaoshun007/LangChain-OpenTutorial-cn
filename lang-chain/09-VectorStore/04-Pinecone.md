## What is Pinecone?

![pinecone_logo](./img/04-pinecone-logo.png)

```Pinecone``` is a managed vector database that allows developers to build fast, scalable, and cost-efficient vector search applications. 

It efficiently handles high-dimensional vector data, providing features such as **indexing**, **searching**, and **filtering** for embedding-based applications.

### Key Features of Pinecone:

1. **Scalable Vector Indexing**: Handles billions of vectors with low latency.

2. **Fast and Accurate Search**: Supports similarity search using various distance metrics.

3. **Metadata Filtering**: Enables filtering based on metadata tags.

4. **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic search with keyword filtering.

5. **Managed Service**: Automatically scales and manages resources.

6. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with popular machine learning frameworks and embeddings.

## Prepare Data

This section guides you through the **data preparation process** .

This section includes the following components:

- Data Introduction

- Preprocess Data


### Data Introduction

In this tutorial, we will use the fairy tale **ðŸ“— The Little Prince** in PDF format as our data.

This material complies with the **Apache 2.0 license** .

The data is used in a text (.txt) format converted from the original PDF.

You can view the data at the link below.
- [Data Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sohyunwriter/the_little_prince)

### Preprocess Data

In this tutorial section, we will preprocess the text data from The Little Prince and convert it into a list of ```LangChain Document``` objects with metadata. 

Each document chunk will include a ```title``` field in the metadata, extracted from the first line of each section.

```python
from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
import re
from typing import List


def preprocessing_data(content: str) -> List[Document]:
    # 1. Split the text by double newlines to separate sections
    blocks = content.split("\n\n")

    # 2. Initialize the text splitter
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=500,  # Maximum number of characters per chunk
        chunk_overlap=50,  # Overlap between chunks to preserve context
        separators=["\n\n", "\n", " "],  # Order of priority for splitting
    )

    documents = []

    # 3. Loop through each section
    for block in blocks:
        lines = block.strip().splitlines()
        if not lines:
            continue

        # Extract title from the first line using square brackets [ ]
        first_line = lines[0]
        title_match = re.search(r"\[(.*?)\]", first_line)
        title = title_match.group(1).strip() if title_match else ""

        # Remove the title line from content
        body = "\n".join(lines[1:]).strip()
        if not body:
            continue

        # 4. Chunk the section using the text splitter
        chunks = text_splitter.split_text(body)

        # 5. Create a LangChain Document for each chunk with the same title metadata
        for chunk in chunks:
            documents.append(Document(page_content=chunk, metadata={"title": title}))

    print(f"Generated {len(documents)} chunked documents.")

    return documents
```

```python
# Load the entire text file
with open("./data/the_little_prince.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    content = f.read()

# Preprocessing Data
docs = preprocessing_data(content=content)
```

<pre class="custom">Generated 262 chunked documents.
</pre>

## Setting up Pinecone

This part walks you through the initial setup of ```Pinecone``` .

This section includes the following components:

- Load Embedding Model

- Load Pinecone Client

### Load Embedding Model

In this section, you'll learn how to load an embedding model.

This tutorial uses **OpenAI's** **API-Key** for loading the model.

*ðŸ’¡ If you prefer to use another embedding model, see the instructions below.*
- [Embedding Models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/)

```python
import os
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large", dimensions=1536)
```

### Load Pinecone Client

In this section, we'll show you how to load the **database client object** using the **Python SDK** for ```Pinecone``` .
- [Python SDK Docs](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/overview)

```python
# Create Database Client Object Function
from pinecone import Pinecone
import os


def get_db_client():
    """
    Initializes and returns a VectorStore client instance.
    This function loads configuration (e.g., API key, host) from environment
    variables or default values and creates a client object to interact
    with the Pinecone Python SDK.

    Returns:
        client:ClientType - An instance of the Pinecone client.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If required configuration is missing.
    """
    client = Pinecone(api_key=os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"])
    return client
```

```python
# Get DB Client Object
client = get_db_client()
```

## Document Manager

For the **LangChain-OpenTutorial**, we have implemented a custom set of **CRUD** functionalities for VectorDBs

The following operations are included:

- ```upsert``` : Update existing documents or insert if they donâ€™t exist

- ```upsert_parallel``` : Perform upserts in parallel for large-scale data

- ```similarity_search``` : Search for similar documents based on embeddings

- ```delete``` : Remove documents based on filter conditions

Each of these features is implemented as class methods specific to each VectorDB.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use these methods to interact with your VectorDB.

*We plan to continuously expand the functionality by adding more common operations in the future.*

### Create Instance

First, we create an instance of the **{vectordb}** helper class to use its CRUD functionalities.

This class is initialized with the **{vectordb} Python SDK client instance** and the **embedding model instance** , both of which were defined in the previous section.

```python
from utils.pinecone import PineconeDocumentManager

crud_manager = PineconeDocumentManager(
    client=client, embedding=embedding.embed_documents
)
```

Now you can use the following **CRUD** operations with the ```crud_manager``` instance.

These instance allow you to easily manage documents in your **{vectordb}** .

### Upsert Document

**Update** existing documents or **insert** if they donâ€™t exist

**âœ… Args**

- ```texts``` : Iterable[str] â€“ List of text contents to be inserted/updated.

- ```metadatas``` : Optional[List[Dict]] â€“ List of metadata dictionaries for each text (optional).

- ```ids``` : Optional[List[str]] â€“ Custom IDs for the documents. If not provided, IDs will be auto-generated.

- ```**kwargs``` : Extra arguments for the underlying vector store.

**ðŸ”„ Return**

- None

```python
from uuid import uuid4

args = {
    "texts": [doc.page_content for doc in docs[:2]],
    "metadatas": [doc.metadata for doc in docs[:2]],
    "ids": [str(uuid4()) for _ in docs[:2]],
    # Add additional parameters if you need
}

crud_manager.upsert(**args)
```

<pre class="custom">2 data upserted
</pre>

### Upsert Parallel

Perform **upsert** in **parallel** for large-scale data

**âœ… Args**

- ```texts``` : Iterable[str] â€“ List of text contents to be inserted/updated.

- ```metadatas``` : Optional[List[Dict]] â€“ List of metadata dictionaries for each text (optional).

- ```ids``` : Optional[List[str]] â€“ Custom IDs for the documents. If not provided, IDs will be auto-generated.

- ```batch_size``` : int â€“ Number of documents per batch (default: 32).

- ```workers``` : int â€“ Number of parallel workers (default: 10).

- ```**kwargs``` : Extra arguments for the underlying vector store.

**ðŸ”„ Return**

- None

```python
from uuid import uuid4

args = {
    "texts": [doc.page_content for doc in docs],
    "metadatas": [doc.metadata for doc in docs],
    "ids": [str(uuid4()) for _ in docs],
     # Add additional parameters if you need
}

crud_manager.upsert_parallel(**args)
```

<pre class="custom">262 data upserted
</pre>

### Similarity Search

Search for **similar documents** based on **embeddings** .

This method uses **"cosine similarity"** .


**âœ… Args**

- ```query``` : str â€“ The text query for similarity search.

- ```k``` : int â€“ Number of top results to return (default: 10).

```**kwargs``` : Additional search options (e.g., filters).

**ðŸ”„ Return**

- ```results``` : List[Document] â€“ A list of LangChain Document objects ranked by similarity.

```python
# Search by query
results = crud_manager.search(query="What is essential is invisible to the eye.", k=3)
for idx, doc in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Rank {idx} | Title : {doc.metadata['title']}")
    print(f"Contents : {doc.page_content}")
    print()
```

<pre class="custom">Rank 0 | Title : Chapter 24
    Contents : "Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert-- what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!" 
    "I am glad," he said, "that you agree with my fox."
    
    Rank 1 | Title : Chapter 21
    Contents : And he went back to meet the fox. 
    "Goodbye," he said. 
    "Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye." 
    "What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
    "It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."
    
    Rank 2 | Title : Chapter 25
    Contents : "The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden-- and they do not find in it what they are looking for." 
    "They do not find it," I replied. 
    "And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water." 
    "Yes, that is true," I said. 
    And the little prince added: 
    "But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."
    
</pre>

```python
# Search by query with filters
results = crud_manager.search(
    query="Which asteroid did the little prince come from?",
    k=3,
    filter={"title": "Chapter 4"},
)
for idx, doc in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Rank {idx} | Title : {doc.metadata['title']}")
    print(f"Contents : {doc.page_content}")
    print()
```

<pre class="custom">Rank 0 | Title : Chapter 4
    Contents : I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612. This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909. 
    (picture)
    On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.
    Grown-ups are like that...
    
    Rank 1 | Title : Chapter 4
    Contents : - the narrator speculates as to which asteroid from which the little prince cameã€€ã€€
    I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!
    
    Rank 2 | Title : Chapter 4
    Contents : Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.

### as_retriever

The ```as_retriever()``` method creates a LangChain-compatible retriever wrapper.

This function allows a ```DocumentManager``` class to return a retriever object by wrapping the internal ```search()``` method, while staying lightweight and independent from full LangChain ```VectorStore``` dependencies.

The retriever obtained through this function is compatible with existing LangChain retrievers and can be used in LangChain Pipelines (e.g., RetrievalQA, ConversationalRetrievalChain, Tool, etc.)

**âœ… Args**

- ```search_fn``` : Callable - The function used to retrieve relevant documents. Typically this is ```self.search``` from a ```DocumentManager``` instance.

- ```search_kwargs``` : Optional[Dict] - A dictionary of keyword arguments passed to ```search_fn```, such as ```k``` for top-K results or metadata filters.

**ðŸ”„ Return**

- ```LightCustomRetriever``` :BaseRetriever - A lightweight LangChain-compatible retriever that internally uses the given ```search_fn``` and ```search_kwargs```.

```python
# Search without filters
ret = crud_manager.as_retriever(
    search_fn=crud_manager.search, search_kwargs={"k": 1}
)
```

```python
ret.invoke("Which asteroid did the little prince come from?")
```
